## First Task Completed in CodeAlpha Web Development Internship!

I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my first task in the **CodeAlpha Web Development Internship Program**.

### Project: Age Calculator
My first task was to build an Age Calculator using JavaScript. This handy tool helps you quickly calculate your exact age by simply inputting your date of birth. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing accurate results in just a few clicks.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my journey in web development!
